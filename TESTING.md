# Testing

## 1. Functionality testing
I've performed regular tests through out development for the usability and performance of the game. Played the game several times (more than 100 rounds) and manually tested hundreds times to see how APIs would respond to this 'flood'. No problems found with it.

I also tested responsive design and performance for different browsers including all OS (Windows, Mac and Linux) without any major problems found:
- Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Firefox
- Safari

## 2. Code validation
