# Guess the Word: The Game

## 1. Description
Guess the Word is a game where you have the hint of a word and you have to guess the missing characters of the word. I got inspired by childhood game 'Hangman' and also spanish TV show 'Pasapalabra'. The game is powered by two APIs and relies on them to work:
- [Random words API](https://random-word-api.vercel.app/): Used for getting random words.
- [Free dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/): Used for retrieving word definitions and phonetics.

### Design
I decided to keep my design very minimalist and colourful at the same time. 

#### **Colors**
These are the colors I've chosen for my design:

#### **Fonts**
These are the fonts I've chosen for my design, both found on Google Fonts:
- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins): Used for headings and paragraphs, most of the text content.
- [Passion One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Passion+One): Used for logo and buttons.

I've used few icons from Font Awesome for buttons:
