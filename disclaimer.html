        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
            This game is powered by two <strong>free</strong> APIs: <a class="link" href="https://random-word-api.vercel.app" target="_blank">Random Words API</a> and <a class="link" href="https://dictionaryapi.dev/" target="_blank">Dictionary API</a>. Being said that, I don't take responsibility for all the content of the words and definitions given, they are retrieved from both APIs and there's thousands of words.
            <br>
            I advice you are <strong>18+ years old</strong> for playing the game as it might contain definitions that you could find 'sensitive'.
            <br>
            Game relies on these both APIs to work, it can stop working anytime if any of these two APIs change or go offline, I will regularly check on it.

            <i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap icon dark-icon"></i>Made for educational purposes
        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
            I've created <strong>Guess the Word: The Game</strong> for learning JavaScript and working with APIs. I also find it very educational for the player too, you can learn hundreds of words, <strong>grammar</strong> and <strong>phonetics</strong>. Challenge your friends for a 10 rounds game, It's much fun!
